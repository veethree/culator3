# culator3
Third iteration of my calculator that meets my oddly specific calculator app needs. This time it's powered by javascript and HTML.

It's set up as a Flask app, But all flask does is serve the page, All the calculator stuff happens client side with javascript/jquery. It's pretty thanks to bootstrap.
